  "description" : "[This mod should be compatible with Frackin' Universe]\n\nThis mod adds a bunch of modern-day weapons to the game. It also adds several unique crafting materials required for these weapons and a new alt ability. \nIt is currently in development and will be updated regularly with fresh content and bugfixes. Custom sounds added in this mod are (as far as I am aware) royalty free sounds made by others. My goal is to have at least 50+ weapons before I stop updating. \n\nSuggestions are welcome! \nIf you need to contact me directly about a specific question or any such thing, my Discord is [FireBjorne#2381]\n\nThese weapon sprites are made in a slightly higher resolution than the game itself, then scaled back down using code to a proper, reasonable size. This allows for a higher degree of detail without the weapons looking out of place and uncomfortably high-res.\n\nAll weapon and material recipes are learned through obtaining one of their component parts.\n\n*LIST OF WEAPONS*\n\nRifles:\nAK-47 (Tier 6)\nSIG 522 (Tier 6)\nM4A1 Carbine (Tier 7)\nSteyr AUG (Tier 7)\nFN SCAR-H (Tier 7)\nM249 SAW (Tier 7)\n\nPistols:\nBeretta M9 (Tier 6)\nM1911 (Tier 6)\nTaurus Judge (Tier 7)\nMRI Desert Eagle (Tier 7)\nFN Five-seveN (Tier 7)\n\nMachine Pistols:\nCZ Scorpion Evo 3 [Stockless, 1 Handed] (Tier 7)\nCZ Scorpion Evo 3 [With stock, 2 Handed] (Tier 7)\n\nSnipers:\nMarlin 1895 (Tier 6)\nBarrett M82A1 \"Light Fifty\" (Tier 7)\n\n*LIST OF MATERIALS*\n\nPlastic - Required for M4A1 Carbine, Beretta M9, M249 SAW, SIG 522, Steyr AUG\nTan Plastic - Required for FN SCAR-H,  Barrett M82A1, FN Five-seveN, Steyr AUG\nRefined Wood - Required for M1911, AK-47, Marlin 1895\nCZ Scorpion Parts Kit - Required to convert Stockless CZ Scorpion\n\n*HELP NEEDED*\n\nI would greatly appreciate any help with balance testing. If anyone is willing, test out these weapons and compare them to other weapons in their tier. My goal is for these weapons to be slightly above others in their tier. Feedback is greatly appreciated!\n\nSpecial thanks to the following users for their invaluable feedback and suggestions: \n- SilverDrake17\n- hdevaney\n- atomic warlord\n- Premane\n- ðŸ’€SkullðŸ’€\n- S4SA",
