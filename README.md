# FireBjorne's Modern Arsenal for Starbound
# https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1576535426

This mod adds a bunch of modern-day weapons to the game. It also adds several unique crafting materials required for these weapons and a new alt ability.
It is currently in development and will be updated regularly with fresh content and bugfixes. Custom sounds added in this mod are (as far as I am aware) royalty free sounds made by others.  

Suggestions are welcome!

These weapon sprites are made in a slightly higher resolution than the game itself, then scaled back down using code to a proper, reasonable size. This allows for a higher degree of detail without the weapons looking out of place and uncomfortably high-res.  

All weapon and material recipes are learned through obtaining one of their component parts. Weapons are craftable at a Replicator.
